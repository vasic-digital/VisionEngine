# AGENTS.md — VisionEngine

## MANDATORY: Project-Agnostic / 100% Decoupled

**This module MUST remain 100% decoupled from any consuming project. It is designed for generic use with ANY project, not one specific consumer.**

- NEVER hardcode project-specific package names, endpoints, device serials, or region-specific data
- NEVER import anything from a consuming project
- NEVER add project-specific defaults, presets, or fixtures into source code
- All project-specific data MUST be registered by the caller via public APIs — never baked into the library
- Default values MUST be empty or generic

Violations void the release. Refactor to restore generic behaviour before any commit.

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## For AI Agents Working on This Codebase

### Module Purpose
VisionEngine provides computer vision (GoCV) and LLM Vision capabilities for UI analysis, navigation graph building, and video frame extraction.

### Key Packages
- `pkg/analyzer` — Analyzer interface, ScreenAnalysis, UIElement, VisualIssue types
- `pkg/graph` — NavigationGraph with BFS pathfinding, DOT/JSON/Mermaid export
- `pkg/llmvision` — VisionProvider interface, 7 LLM adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, StepFun, Ollama) + FallbackProvider
- `pkg/remote` — Remote Ollama deployment via SSH, hardware detection (GPU/CPU/RAM), llama.cpp RPC worker management
- `pkg/opencv` — GoCV stubs (real impl behind `//go:build vision` tag)
- `pkg/config` — Configuration via environment variables

### Vision Providers
- **Cloud**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, StepFun — configured via API key env vars
- **Local**: Ollama — free inference, no rate limits, configured via `HELIX_OLLAMA_URL`
- **Distributed**: llama.cpp RPC — splits large models across hosts via `HELIX_LLAMACPP_RPC_WORKERS`
- **Fallback**: `FallbackProvider` chains multiple providers for resilience
- Provider selection via `HELIX_VISION_PROVIDER` (`auto` probes all configured providers)

### Build Tags
OpenCV code is gated behind `//go:build vision`. Default `go test ./...` works without OpenCV.

### Testing
```bash
go test ./... -race -count=1          # Without OpenCV (default)
go test -tags vision ./... -race      # With OpenCV (requires OpenCV 4.x)
```

### Key Interfaces
- `analyzer.Analyzer` — screen analysis (6 methods)
- `graph.NavigationGraph` — directed graph (10 methods, thread-safe)
- `llmvision.VisionProvider` — LLM vision API (4 methods)


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

## Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
sends the host to suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, poweroff, halt,
reboot, or any other power-state transition.** This rule applies to:

- Every shell command you run via the Bash tool.
- Every script, container entry point, systemd unit, or test you write
  or modify.
- Every CLI suggestion, snippet, or example you emit.

**Forbidden invocations** (non-exhaustive — see CONST-033 in
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the full list):

- `systemctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec`
- `loginctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot`
- `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate`, `shutdown -h|-r|-P|now`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend|Hibernate|PowerOff|Reboot|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to anything but `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI agents and container
workloads. Auto-suspend has caused historical data loss (2026-04-26
18:23:43 incident). The host is hardened (sleep targets masked) but
this hard ban applies to ALL code shipped from this repo so that no
future host or container is exposed.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` (static
scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` (challenge wrapper).
Both MUST be wired into the project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Full background:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-033).

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

<!-- BEGIN no-session-termination addendum (CONST-036) -->

## User-Session Termination — Hard Ban (CONST-036)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
ends the currently-logged-in user's desktop session, kills their
`user@<UID>.service` user manager, or indirectly forces them to
manually log out / power off.** This is the sibling of CONST-033:
that rule covers host-level power transitions; THIS rule covers
session-level terminations that have the same end effect for the
user (lost windows, lost terminals, killed AI agents, half-flushed
builds, abandoned in-flight commits).

**Why this rule exists.** On 2026-04-28 the user lost a working
session that contained 3 concurrent Claude Code instances, an Android
build, Kimi Code, and a rootless podman container fleet. The
`user.slice` consumed 60.6 GiB peak / 5.2 GiB swap, the GUI became
unresponsive, the user was forced to log out and then power off via
the GNOME shell. The host could not auto-suspend (CONST-033 was in
place and verified) and the kernel OOM killer never fired — but the
user had to manually end the session anyway, because nothing
prevented overlapping heavy workloads from saturating the slice.
CONST-036 closes that loophole at both the source-code layer and the
operational layer. See
`docs/issues/fixed/SESSION_LOSS_2026-04-28.md` in the HelixAgent
project.

**Forbidden direct invocations** (non-exhaustive):

- `loginctl terminate-user|terminate-session|kill-user|kill-session`
- `systemctl stop user@<UID>` / `systemctl kill user@<UID>`
- `gnome-session-quit`
- `pkill -KILL -u $USER` / `killall -u $USER`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout|Shutdown|Reboot`
- `echo X > /sys/power/state`
- `/usr/bin/poweroff`, `/usr/bin/reboot`, `/usr/bin/halt`

**Indirect-pressure clauses:**

1. Do not spawn parallel heavy workloads casually; check `free -h`
   first; keep `user.slice` under 70% of physical RAM.
2. Long-lived background subagents go in `system.slice`. Rootless
   podman containers die with the user manager.
3. Document AI-agent concurrency caps in CLAUDE.md.
4. Never script "log out and back in" recovery flows.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-session-termination-calls.sh`
(static scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_session_termination_calls_challenge.sh`
(challenge wrapper). Both MUST be wired into the project's CI /
`run_all_challenges.sh`.
