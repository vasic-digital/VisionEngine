# AGENTS.md — VisionEngine

## MANDATORY: Project-Agnostic / 100% Decoupled

**This module MUST remain 100% decoupled from any consuming project. It is designed for generic use with ANY project, not one specific consumer.**

- NEVER hardcode project-specific package names, endpoints, device serials, or region-specific data
- NEVER import anything from a consuming project
- NEVER add project-specific defaults, presets, or fixtures into source code
- All project-specific data MUST be registered by the caller via public APIs — never baked into the library
- Default values MUST be empty or generic

Violations void the release. Refactor to restore generic behaviour before any commit.

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## For AI Agents Working on This Codebase

### Module Purpose
VisionEngine provides computer vision (GoCV) and LLM Vision capabilities for UI analysis, navigation graph building, and video frame extraction.

### Key Packages
- `pkg/analyzer` — Analyzer interface, ScreenAnalysis, UIElement, VisualIssue types
- `pkg/graph` — NavigationGraph with BFS pathfinding, DOT/JSON/Mermaid export
- `pkg/llmvision` — VisionProvider interface, 7 LLM adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, StepFun, Ollama) + FallbackProvider
- `pkg/remote` — Remote Ollama deployment via SSH, hardware detection (GPU/CPU/RAM), llama.cpp RPC worker management
- `pkg/opencv` — GoCV stubs (real impl behind `//go:build vision` tag)
- `pkg/config` — Configuration via environment variables

### Vision Providers
- **Cloud**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, StepFun — configured via API key env vars
- **Local**: Ollama — free inference, no rate limits, configured via `HELIX_OLLAMA_URL`
- **Distributed**: llama.cpp RPC — splits large models across hosts via `HELIX_LLAMACPP_RPC_WORKERS`
- **Fallback**: `FallbackProvider` chains multiple providers for resilience
- Provider selection via `HELIX_VISION_PROVIDER` (`auto` probes all configured providers)

### Build Tags
OpenCV code is gated behind `//go:build vision`. Default `go test ./...` works without OpenCV.

### Testing
```bash
go test ./... -race -count=1          # Without OpenCV (default)
go test -tags vision ./... -race      # With OpenCV (requires OpenCV 4.x)
```

### Key Interfaces
- `analyzer.Analyzer` — screen analysis (6 methods)
- `graph.NavigationGraph` — directed graph (10 methods, thread-safe)
- `llmvision.VisionProvider` — LLM vision API (4 methods)


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**
