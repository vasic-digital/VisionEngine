## MANDATORY: Project-Agnostic / 100% Decoupled

**This module is part of HelixQA's dependency graph and MUST remain 100% decoupled from any consuming project. It is designed for generic use with ANY project, not just ATMOSphere.**

- **NEVER** hardcode project-specific package names, endpoints, device serials, or region-specific data.
- **NEVER** import anything from the consuming project.
- **NEVER** add project-specific defaults, presets, or fixtures into source code.
- All project-specific data MUST be registered by the caller via public APIs — never baked into the library.
- Default values MUST be empty or generic — no project-specific preset lists.

**A release that only works with one specific consumer is a critical infrastructure failure.** Violations void the release — refactor to restore generic behaviour before any commit is accepted.

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## Project Overview

VisionEngine is a Go module providing computer vision and LLM Vision for UI analysis and navigation graph building.

**Module path:** `digital.vasic.visionengine`

## Build Commands

```bash
# Tests (no OpenCV required)
go test ./... -race -count=1

# Build
go build ./...

# With OpenCV
go build -tags vision ./...
go test -tags vision ./... -race -count=1
```

## MANDATORY: Never Remove or Disable Tests

All issues must be fixed by addressing root causes. No test may ever be removed, disabled, skipped, or left broken.

## Architecture

- `pkg/analyzer/` - Core interfaces and types
- `pkg/graph/` - NavigationGraph (most important, imported by HelixQA)
- `pkg/llmvision/` - LLM Vision API adapters (pure Go HTTP)
  - `openai.go` - OpenAI GPT-4o vision
  - `anthropic.go` - Anthropic Claude vision
  - `gemini.go` - Google Gemini vision
  - `qwen.go` - Qwen VL vision
  - `kimi.go` - Kimi/Moonshot vision
  - `stepgui.go` - StepFun vision
  - `ollama.go` - Local Ollama vision (free, no rate limits)
  - `fallback.go` - FallbackProvider for multi-provider resilience
- `pkg/remote/` - Remote Ollama deployment via SSH, hardware detection, llama.cpp RPC
- `pkg/opencv/` - OpenCV stubs (real impl behind `//go:build vision`)
- `pkg/config/` - Configuration

## Vision Providers

VisionEngine supports multiple vision providers with automatic fallback:

- **Cloud providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, StepFun
- **Local providers**: Ollama (any vision model, e.g. `minicpm-v:8b`, `llava:7b`)
- **Distributed inference**: llama.cpp RPC splits large models across multiple hosts

Provider selection is set via `HELIX_VISION_PROVIDER` (default: `auto`). In `auto` mode, the system probes all configured providers and uses the FallbackProvider for resilience.

## Local Model Support

Ollama integration (`pkg/llmvision/ollama.go`) provides:
- Zero-cost local inference with no rate limits
- Automatic model availability checking
- Compatible with any Ollama vision model
- Remote Ollama auto-deployment via SSH (`pkg/remote/`)

## Distributed Vision

The `pkg/remote/` package supports:
- Hardware detection (GPU/CPU/RAM) on remote hosts
- llama.cpp RPC worker management for splitting models across machines
- Automatic Ollama installation and model pulling on remote hosts

## Build Tags

- Default: Stubs for OpenCV, LLM providers work
- `vision`: Full OpenCV/GoCV support

## Key Patterns

- NavigationGraph uses `sync.RWMutex` for thread safety
- BFS pathfinding for shortest path
- FallbackProvider for multi-provider resilience
- All providers validate inputs before API calls


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**
