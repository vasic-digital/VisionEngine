# AGENTS.md — VisionEngine

## MANDATORY: No CI/CD Pipelines

**NO GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or any automated pipeline may exist in this repository!**

- No `.github/workflows/` directory
- No `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
- No Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml, .circleci, or any other CI configuration
- All builds and tests are run manually or via Makefile targets
- This rule is permanent and non-negotiable

## For AI Agents Working on This Codebase

### Module Purpose
VisionEngine provides computer vision (GoCV) and LLM Vision capabilities for UI analysis, navigation graph building, and video frame extraction.

### Key Packages
- `pkg/analyzer` — Analyzer interface, ScreenAnalysis, UIElement, VisualIssue types
- `pkg/graph` — NavigationGraph with BFS pathfinding, DOT/JSON/Mermaid export
- `pkg/llmvision` — VisionProvider interface, 4 LLM adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Qwen)
- `pkg/opencv` — GoCV stubs (real impl behind `//go:build vision` tag)
- `pkg/config` — Configuration via environment variables

### Build Tags
OpenCV code is gated behind `//go:build vision`. Default `go test ./...` works without OpenCV.

### Testing
```bash
go test ./... -race -count=1          # Without OpenCV (default)
go test -tags vision ./... -race      # With OpenCV (requires OpenCV 4.x)
```

### Key Interfaces
- `analyzer.Analyzer` — screen analysis (6 methods)
- `graph.NavigationGraph` — directed graph (10 methods, thread-safe)
- `llmvision.VisionProvider` — LLM vision API (4 methods)

## Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
sends the host to suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, poweroff, halt,
reboot, or any other power-state transition.** This rule applies to:

- Every shell command you run via the Bash tool.
- Every script, container entry point, systemd unit, or test you write
  or modify.
- Every CLI suggestion, snippet, or example you emit.

**Forbidden invocations** (non-exhaustive — see CONST-033 in
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the full list):

- `systemctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec`
- `loginctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot`
- `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate`, `shutdown -h|-r|-P|now`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend|Hibernate|PowerOff|Reboot|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to anything but `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI agents and container
workloads. Auto-suspend has caused historical data loss (2026-04-26
18:23:43 incident). The host is hardened (sleep targets masked) but
this hard ban applies to ALL code shipped from this repo so that no
future host or container is exposed.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` (static
scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` (challenge wrapper).
Both MUST be wired into the project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Full background:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-033).
